WORKSHOP 6 

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop 6, I , learned how to implement a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator.
I learned how to manage a class with dynamic resources and to use existing objects to create new ones
or to assign values to existing objects based on pre-existing ones
I also learned how to implement custom input/output operators in this workshop.
In part 1 of the workshop, I made a module called Numbers which was responsible for reading several
double values from a file (one number per line) and hold them dynamically in memory. Then the caller
application has the option of adding numbers to the collection. This Module can provide information
about the numbers and display them on the screen in ascending order, can find the largest value, can 
find the smallest value, can calculate the average of the values in the collection
In part-2 of the workshop i.e. DIY, I coded a module called Basket which was responsble to hold the 
information about a fruit basket.
I faced a problem in the second part of the workshop. My output was matching with the one given
and I had no compilation errors but while submiting, I got to know about my memory leaks. I immediately
read the studentoutput.txt and fixed what was wrong with the code.
