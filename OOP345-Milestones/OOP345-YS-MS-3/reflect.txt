I think the milestone I completed this time was the most difficult project 
during the CPA course. First, I needed a very long time to understand the 
overall logic. Frankly, I didn't find it difficult to complete Milestones 
1 and 2 without a complete understanding of Logic. However, in Milestone 3,
I learned the most important thing. It is very dangerous and difficult to 
proceed without knowing the whole process while working on a project. As a 
result, I had to review 1 and 2 as I progressed to Milestone 3, and I was 
able to implement 3 by understanding the overall process.

Throughout this milestone, I got used to STL containers and algorithms a lot 
and got used to them. And it was fun to implement the link-list algorithm 
using the container. Apart from that, the challenge of using STL algorithms 
instead of basic a loop statement, such as for or while, in LineManager 
constructor interested me. As a result of a lot of practice and study at the 
last workshop, this challenge was not that difficult. Thanks to this, there 
was an opportunity to practice implementing using STL algorithms not only in 
the LineManager constructor but also in other functions. For example, "run" 
or "display" function in LineManager.cpp
