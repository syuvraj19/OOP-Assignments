WORKSHOP 8 and Milestone-2 

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop 8, I learned how to define a pure virtual 
function.I learned how to code an abstract base class and 
how to implement behavior declared in a pure virtual 
function.I can now explain the difference between an 
abstract base class and a concrete class.
For the milestone 2, I had to make a mockup application 
for the Seneca Library Application. I had to make the 
mentioned in a module called LibApp. This module would give
a demo of how the application for Seneca Library would work.
I had to print the messages instead of actually performing the
tasks. I also used the Menu module in this milestone.
