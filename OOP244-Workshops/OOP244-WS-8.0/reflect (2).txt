I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned how to define a pure virtual function and how to 
code an abstract base class and implement behaviour declared in a pure virtual
function. Moreover, learned how to create a concrete class that derives from a 
pure interface abstract base class.

Also learned the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class 
that is, An abstract base class contains one or more pure virtual functions and 
has no implementation while a concrete class has implementations in all its 
member functions.

Also identified the functions that shadow functions of the same name in the 
solution the functions are- bool credit(double), bool debit(double), void monthEnd(),
and void display(std::ostream&) const.

Some of the common errors I faced like some syntax errors and errors like not 
including the header files created some problems but were fixed at the end and 
some errors with the derivation of the base class and derived class and the type 
of derivations also handling the diamond problem using the virtual keyword and 
creating a concrete class by deriving from a pure interface abstract base class.
