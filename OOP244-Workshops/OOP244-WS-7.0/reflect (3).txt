I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I learned the Inheritance of a derived class from a base class while completing this workshop. Moreover, I understood how to use custom input/output operators with the classes. Furthermore, accessing shadowed member function that is defined in a base class. 

Also, shadowing a base class member function with a derived class member function 
gave me a clear explanation of the topics.
One thing that I found by an error is that if we don't do deep copy and go 
with shallow copy on member variables then if we change the value of one 
variable, any other variable will be changed. Also got a good understanding 
fstream objects where ifstream is used for getting data from the file while 
ofstream is used to put data to the file.


Problems faced :
The errors I faced in this lab were related to memory leaks and memory allocation which i got to know in the Valgrind memory check when running code on matrix, the syntax errors were 
identified by and corrected by IntelliSense and adding of header file in the 
basket.cpp and memory leaks were identified by Valgrind on matrix and were
 fixed by figuring out the missing delete[] key when deallocating memory in between.
