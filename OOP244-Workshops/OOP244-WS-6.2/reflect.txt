I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop I learned how to implement the copy assignment operator and 
copy constructor and also revised the concept of dynamic memory allocation, 
these help in managing the dynamic resources of a class and prevent memory 
leaks, also had a good understanding of copying dynamic members of a class 
by the deep copy rather than using shallow copy.

The copy constructor used in the code was- Basket::Basket(const Basket &CopResrc)

One thing that I found by an error is that if we don't do deep copy and go 
with shallow copy on member variables then if we change the value of one 
variable, any other variable will be changed. Also got a good understanding 
fstream objects where ifstream is used for getting data from the file while 
ofstream is used to put data to the file.

The errors I faced in this lab were some syntax errors like not adding 
semi-colons at the end of a few statements and an implementations error when 
I forgot to include the header file in the basket.cpp and other errors were 
related to memory leaks and memory allocation which i got to know in the 
Valgrind memory check when running code on matrix, the syntax errors were 
identified by and corrected by IntelliSense and adding of header file in the 
basket.cpp and memory leaks were identified by Valgrind on matrix and were
 fixed by figuring out the missing delete[] key when deallocating memory in between.
