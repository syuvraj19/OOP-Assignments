  I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
  that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Answer- After completion of this workshop I have understood the use and 
importance of overload function and memory deallocation, overload functions 
simply means different function that happens to have the same name, matter 
of fact I tried to use it in part-1 and had created read function for student 
name, id and grade and named them same as read,The determination of which 
function to use for a particular call is resolved at compile time so it is 
really convenient, unfortunately wasn't able to submit the work on time.

The next thing was memory deallocation which simply means to remove the 
sets of allocated memory from the system after the code has been processed 
to free up the random access memory(RAM), deallocation has been used in both 
the parts, in the DIY it is use to free up the space that has been allocated 
by employee name reservation in memory, you can check the code for reference. 
Deallocation helps preventing memory leaks and when working on big projects 
also helps to prevent system failure.
