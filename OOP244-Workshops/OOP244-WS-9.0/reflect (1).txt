I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned how to Derive a class with resource from a base class
which also includes a dynamic cString and Override virtual and non-virtual methods
of the base class. Moreover, Apply the rule of three to the base and the derived
class and handling text files and conversion to read and write dynamic data from 
int into date files.

The rule of three (also known as the law of the big three or the big three) is a 
rule of thumb in C++ that claims that if a class defines any of the following then 
it should probably explicitly define all three: destructor, copy constructor and 
copy assignment operator

With the virtual keyword on the base class method and the override keyword on the 
method in the derived class, both methods are said to be virtual. Methods that don't 
have either the virtual or override keywords, or that have the new keyword, are said 
to be non-virtual.

Some of the common errors I faced like some syntax errors and errors like not 
including the header files created some problems but were fixed at the end and 
some errors with the difference of definition between Override virtual and non-virtual 
methods but cleared out from previous lecture that the virtual keyword can be used when 
declaring overriding functions in a derived class, but it is unnecessary; overrides of 
virtual functions are always virtual. Virtual functions in a base class must be defined 
unless they are declared using the pure-specifier.
