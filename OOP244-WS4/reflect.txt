WORKSHOP 4

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
The workshop 4 was a tough one. I learned about constructers, 
destructors in this whole workshop. I learned about creating constructors 
and destructors. In the part 1 i.e. the lab, I created a module to collect 
the information from the customers about the cars. I created a default 
constructor called car which initialised the member variable by calling the resetInfo().
In the part 2 of the lab, I created both the constructors and destructors again to 
handle the empty state of the robot and handle any potential memory leak respectively.
Dealing with constructors and destructors was a tough task, I came across memory 
leaks again and again. I then again read the course notes so that I could verify that 
I know that I am doing all te steps correctly while creating them. After finding what I 
was doing wrong, i got to know that I created the deconstructor wrong. So, I debugged my 
code again and after that my code was working fine.
