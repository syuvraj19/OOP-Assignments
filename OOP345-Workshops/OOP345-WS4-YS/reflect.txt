In this workshop I learned to create a custom container class that is in a composition 
relationship with another class. Since this class will contain an array of pointers, 
the rule of 5 (constructor, destructor, copy constructor/assignment, move constructor/assignment) 
had to be kept in consideration throughout this workshop. 

This workshop, refreshed me on how to read lines from a file and parse them into string 
objects based on some simple rules.and I don't have to use strcpy,strcmp functions for 
string object and I also learned how to use string related functions such as find, substr,
Stoi, erase as mentioned in the workshop requirements.

We are already familiar with inheritance and parametric polymorphism between classes,
but in this workshop we also used the different types of relationships that exists according 
To different degrees of ownership between classes that can be represented by composition, 
aggregation and association. 

The difference between composition and aggregation are-

Composition:
1. Type of relationship - "part of"
2. Association type - Strong
3. In composition the cannot exist independently of the parent.

Aggregation:
1. Type of relationship - "has-a"
2. Association type - Weak
3. In aggregation there exhibit a relationship where a child can exist independently of the parent.
