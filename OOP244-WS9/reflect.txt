WORKSHOP 9 and Milestone-3 

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop 9, I learned how to derive a class with 
resource from a base class which also includes a dynamic
cString. I learned the method of how to override a virtual 
and a non-virtual of the base class. I also learned about
how to apply the rule of three to the base and the 
derived class. I also wrote dynamic data from int into 
date files.
In milestone 3 of the project, I had to do some modifications 
to the date module. I had to accomodate the code according 
to the Seneca Library's policies i.e. it holds two types 
of publications, (newspapers and magazines) and books.
Publications are not loaned out to members. Members can 
check them out and read them in the library. These publications 
are put back on their shelves at the end of the day.
The books can be borrowed and returned within 15 days. After 
15 days, the member will be charged daily for a late 
penalty.
