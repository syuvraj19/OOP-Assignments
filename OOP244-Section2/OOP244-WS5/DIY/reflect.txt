WORKSHOP 5

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop 5 this time I learned how to define and create binary 
member operators.I also learned  to define and create various type 
conversion operators,unary operators,helper binary operator between 
classes and helper operators between a primitive type and a class.
In the Lab I implemented two modules called Chapter and Book.
Chapter class is being used by the Book class in a composition pattern.
In part 2 DIY I had to declare four private data members. Those were:
1)An array to hold the name of a hero, not exceeding MAX_NAME_LEN characters.
2)A Pointer of type Power that will hold a dynamic set of powers a hero 
may have.
3)An integer variable for the number of powers a hero may have.
4)An integer variable for the power level of a hero.

All this had to be a calculated value. which was calculated as
Sum of rarity of all the heroes' powers multiplied by the total count of powers.
This time I only had a few compilation errors because I wrote some code at the 
wrong place, overall everything else was okay.
