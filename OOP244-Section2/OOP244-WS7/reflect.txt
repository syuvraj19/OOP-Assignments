WORKSHOP 7 and Milestone-1 

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop-7 I learned how to inherit a derived class from a base class
and how to shadow a base class member function with a derived class member
function. I then learned how to access that shadowed member function that is 
defined in a base class. I learned how to utilize custom input/output operators
with these classes.
In milestone 1 of the project, I was assigned to make three modules, Date, MenuItem 
and Menu. In the Date module, I had to make sure that the year should be an integer
between 1500 to 2022, the month should be an integer from 1 to 12 and the day should
be the from 1 to the number of days that the month enter has. The MenuItem holds the 
Item in the menu to be selected by the customer. This had to be a private class
which was only allowed to be accessed by Menu. The Menu was used to display the several items
selected in the MenuItem.
