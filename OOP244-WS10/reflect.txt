MILESTONE 5 and WORKSHOP 10

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/
In workshop 10, I have learned to code function templates and 
implement calls to function templates.

In milestone 5, I first added all the latest versions of my modules 
of the earlier milestones. I had to create two new modules for the 
milestone this time. First of them was the PublicationSelector Module
and the second one was LibApp Module.

This was the toughest workshop and milestone of the course. It was a time 
consuming one and I faced a bit of difficulties as well. In the areas where
I found myself struggling, I went to the lecture again and understood the 
concepts again.
