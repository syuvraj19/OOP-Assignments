WORKSHOP 3

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/

While doing the workshop 3 I learned about using member functions to 
query and change the state of an object. I learned to use standard 
library to format data inserted in to the output stream. During this 
workshop I learned how to define a class type and how to privatize the data within it.
In the part 1 of the lab I was required to declare three private data 
types and implement a set of public member functions i.e. setEmpty(),
createArmy(), updateUnits(),checkNationality(), checkCapacity(), 
checkPower(), is Empty(), isStrongerThan()and two global functions battle(), 
and display().
In part 2 of the workshop i.e LAB, I had to make a program which receives 
sample values  and creates a bar chart based on it. 
I faced a problem in the lab since I forgot to make a member variable to 
hold the fill character. When I came across a problem in the output I 
immediately started to walkthrough my code and came across the problem 
mentioned above. I, then created a variableto hold the fill character and ran the 
code once again which helped solve the problem and successful submission of the workshop.
